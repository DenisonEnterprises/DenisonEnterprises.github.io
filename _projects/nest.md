For years Denison's 3rd floor space in Slayter was vacant and lonely. There was so much opportunity, but there was unfortunately no action.

When Denison Enterprises saw this void, we sprung into action. What started as an idea quickly came to fruition. The Nest was opened the spring of 2015 and has seen continual operation ever since. It quickly became a student favorite with its greasy melts and late-night vibes.

Put this one in the "win column" for DE.
