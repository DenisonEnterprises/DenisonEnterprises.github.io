The Bandersnatch is an on-campus coffeehouse that serves Denison students from the hours of 9pm until the wee hours of the morning. The organization itself has been around for decades, but it seems that they have always struggled with efficiency and turning a profit. Enter Denison Enterprises.

After several weeks of planning and deliberation, we worked with the Bandersnatch to create a plan that would improve their long-term profitability and efficiency. This included improved pricing, staff training, better inventory practices, and an app that allowed remote ordering and customer analytics.

Though our partnership has now ended, the Bandersnatch holds a special place in the hearts of Denison Enterprise members' hearts. Who couldn't love the late-night hangout spot that popularized the Snagel?
