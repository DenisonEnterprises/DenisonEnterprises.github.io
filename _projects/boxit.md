"I live in another state (or country) and have to pay for an entire storage unit to keep my things at Denison over the summer." When we heard this from Denison students we knew we could find a solution. Introducing Box!t.

One of Denison Enterprises' longest running projects, Box!t is a student-centric business that enables students to store their belongings for the summer for a reasonable price. In its few years of operation Box!t has served several hundred students, generated tens of thousands of dollars in revenue, and evolved with the needs of students. While Box!t is only a service for summer storage, we hope to provide it to students studying abroad in the future.
