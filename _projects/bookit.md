Paying for textbooks is a big concern to students. According to the College Board, students spend on average $600 per semester on books. As students, we realized this burden and saw the need for a peer-to-peer textbook re-sale business on campus with the purpose of providing fair prices to both sellers and buyers.

Denison Enterprises works with professors to understand which books will be required for spring semester courses and any previous editions that are also accepted. We will donate a third of our profit to support Denisonâ€™s Annual Fund. Book!T will be piloting in December 2017.
