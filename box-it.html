    <p>One of Denison Enterprises' longest running projects, Box!t is a student-centric business that enables students to store their belongings for the summer for a reasonable price.

            <div class="box-content">
                We do not actually store these boxes on campus! Denison Enterprises works with an off-campus storage facility to meet the needs of our students. We pick up the boxes and take them to our storage facility for the summer.

                Yes. Hazardous material and contraband are strictly prohibited and DE reserves the right to inspect for such items. This means anything flammable or illegal. Additionally, our insurance only covers boxes up to $100. We will NOT cover the following items: jewelry, cash, collectibles, electronic equipment, improperly packed items, unpacked items, damage to storage containers, and minor damage due to handling.
            
				<br><br>Some items that we do NOT store include: TVs, Mattresses, Air Conditioners, Fragile/Valuable items, Guns, Alcohol, etc.
				
				<br><br>If you have a small appliance like a coffee maker, kettle, or a printer, you can pack it in a box and we will store it.
