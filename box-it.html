            <div class="box-content">
                We will be picking up items for storage during the first week of May, which is a week before school ends. Unfortunately that means that you should not store bedding or other items you need before the end of school.

            <div class="box-content">
                We do not actually store these boxes on campus! Denison Enterprises works with an off-campus storage facility to meet the needs of our students. We pick up the boxes and take them to our storage facility for the summer.

Additionally, our insurance only covers boxes up to $100. We will NOT cover the following items: jewelry, cash, collectibles, electronic equipment, improperly packed items, unpacked items, damage to storage containers, and minor damage due to handling.
            
				<br><br>Some items that we do NOT store include: TVs, Mattresses, Air Conditioners, Fragile/Valuable items, Guns, Alcohol, etc.
				
				<br><br>If you have a small appliance like a coffee maker, kettle, or a printer, you can pack it in a box and we will store it.

                Unfortunately we cannot give refunds for unused cardboard boxes. We suggest either buying the cardboard boxes conservatively or choosing the storage bin option which requires you to provide your own bins. We will refund unused storage bin space after the pick up day.
