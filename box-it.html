    <p>One of Denison Enterprises' longest running projects, Box!t is a student-centric business that enables students to store their belongings for the summer for a reasonable price. In its few years of operation Box!t has served several hundred students, generated tens of thousands of dollars in revenue, and evolved with the needs of students.</p>

            <div class="box-content">
                We don't actually store these boxes on campus! Denison Enterprises works with an off-campus storage facility to meet the needs of our students. We pick up the boxes and take them to our storage facility for the summer.

            <div class="box-content">
                Yes. Hazardous material and contraband are strictly prohibited and DE reserves the right to inspect for such items. This means anything flammable or illegal. Additionally, our insurance only covers boxes up to $100. We will NOT cover the following items: jewelry, cash, collectibles, electronic equipment, improperly packed items, unpacked items, damage to storage containers, and minor damage due to handling.

                Denison Enterprises mostly tries to break even on Box!t&mdash;we're mostly in this for the learning experience. That being said, we try to make a little profit as a padding for insurance and continuing operation in the future. Excess profit eventually gets donated to Denison's annual fund for scholarships, supplies, etc.
