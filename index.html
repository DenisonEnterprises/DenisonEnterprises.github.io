  <p>Denison Enterprises, founded in 2014, is an experimental business learning opportunity serving as a think-tank, consultation group, and small business incubator.</p>

  <p>We were inspired to create Denison Enterprises because we saw business needs on campus that were not completely met, ultimately driving students off-campus to meet those needs. Denison Enterprises seeks to bring self-sustaining student run business ventures to campus that provide experimental business learning opportunities to undergraduates.</p>
